# TREFF Post-Generator - Development Progress

## Session - Feature #126: Posts sorted by date display in correct chronological order
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Added sort_by and sort_direction query parameters to backend GET /api/posts endpoint
- Added sort UI controls to HistoryView.vue (sort field dropdown + direction toggle button)
- Backend supports sorting by: created_at, updated_at, title, scheduled_date
- Backend supports asc/desc direction with regex-validated query params
- Frontend passes sort params to API on every fetch

### Files modified:
- backend/app/api/routes/posts.py - Added sort_by/sort_direction params with dynamic sorting
- frontend/src/views/HistoryView.vue - Added sortBy, sortDirection refs, sort controls UI, API param passing

### Verification steps completed:
1. Created 3 test posts with dates Jan 1, Mar 15, Feb 10 - PASS
2. Navigated to History page sorted by date (default: desc) - PASS
   - Order: SORT_TEST_MAR_15 (15.03.2026) -> SORT_TEST_FEB_10 (10.02.2026) -> SORT_TEST_JAN_01 (01.01.2026)
3. Verified posts appear in correct chronological order (newest first) - PASS
4. Toggled sort direction to ascending - PASS
   - Order reversed: SORT_TEST_JAN_01 (01.01.2026) -> SORT_TEST_FEB_10 (10.02.2026) -> SORT_TEST_MAR_15 (15.03.2026)
5. Verified reverse order works (oldest first) - PASS
6. Toggled back to descending - PASS (original order restored)

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] API sort params validated via regex patterns (only allowed values accepted)
- [x] Backend API tested directly: desc and asc both return correct order
- [x] Screenshots captured:
  - feature126-step1-default-sort-desc.png (default descending: newest first)
  - feature126-step2-sort-asc.png (ascending: oldest first)
  - feature126-step3-sort-desc-again.png (toggled back to descending)

### Current state:
- Feature #126 marked as PASSING
- 129/170 features passing (75.9%)

## Session - Feature #123: Malformed URL parameters handled gracefully
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified that malformed URL parameters are handled gracefully throughout the app
- Client-side ID validation and 422 catch were already implemented in EditPostView.vue (from prior sessions)
- Tested multiple malformed URL patterns end-to-end via browser automation

### Code already in place (no new changes needed):
- EditPostView.vue: `Number.isInteger()` validation rejects non-numeric IDs before API call
- EditPostView.vue: catch block handles both 404 and 422 responses as "not found"
- CalendarView.vue: Uses internal state, ignores URL query params entirely
- NotFoundView.vue: Global 404 catch-all for unmatched routes

### Verification steps completed:
1. Navigate to /posts/notanumber/edit - PASS
   - Shows "Post nicht gefunden" 404 page with sad emoji
   - Message: "Der Post mit ID #notanumber existiert nicht, wurde geloescht oder gehoert dir nicht."
   - Navigation buttons "Zur History" and "Zum Dashboard" present and functional
   - No API call made (caught client-side)
2. Verify app does not crash - PASS
   - Zero JavaScript console errors across all tests
   - App remains fully functional after viewing malformed URLs
3. Verify appropriate error or 404 displayed - PASS
   - Beautiful 404 page with emoji, descriptive message, and navigation buttons
   - Also tested: /posts/-1/edit (negative ID), /posts/3.14/edit (float), /posts/99999/edit (nonexistent)
   - All show proper 404 page
4. Navigate to /calendar?month=abc - PASS
   - Calendar loads normally showing current month (February 2026)
   - Invalid query param completely ignored (CalendarView uses internal state)
   - Full calendar functionality works: gap detection, weekly goals, platform filters
5. Verify graceful handling - PASS
   - XSS payload in URL (/posts/<script>alert(1)</script>/edit) falls through to global 404
   - No script execution, no crashes

### Additional edge cases tested:
- /posts/-1/edit -> 404 page (negative number rejected by validation)
- /posts/3.14/edit -> 404 page (float rejected by Number.isInteger check)
- /posts/99999/edit -> 404 page (valid int, but API returns 404 for nonexistent post)
- /posts/<script>alert(1)</script>/edit -> global 404 page (route doesn't match)
- "Zur History" button navigates correctly to /history

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] No 500s in network requests
- [x] Navigation buttons work correctly
- [x] Screenshots captured:
  - feature123-step1-notanumber-edit.png (before fix - validation error)
  - feature123-step2-notanumber-404.png (after fix - clean 404 page)
  - feature123-step3-negative-id.png (-1 shows 404)
  - feature123-step4-float-id.png (3.14 shows 404)
  - feature123-step5-calendar-abc.png (calendar ignores invalid param)
  - feature123-step6-xss-in-id.png (XSS in URL shows global 404)
  - feature123-step7-valid-nonexistent-id.png (99999 shows 404 via API)
  - feature123-step8-notanumber-no-toast.png (clean 404 without toast)

### Current state:
- Feature #123 marked as PASSING
- 126/170 features passing (74.1%)

## Session - Feature #124: Scheduled post shows correct date in calendar timezone
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified the complete scheduled post date/time display in calendar views end-to-end via browser
- No code changes needed - all functionality was already fully implemented:
  - Backend: PUT /api/posts/{post_id}/schedule endpoint stores scheduled_date and scheduled_time
  - Backend: GET /api/calendar?month=3&year=2025 returns posts grouped by date with correct date/time
  - Frontend: CalendarView.vue month view shows post card on correct date with time
  - Frontend: CalendarView.vue week view shows post card in correct 14:00 time slot

### Verification steps completed:
1. Schedule a post for 2025-03-15 at 14:00 - PASS

   - API response confirmed: scheduled_date "2025-03-15T00:00:00", scheduled_time "14:00", status "scheduled"
2. Navigate to Calendar - PASS
   - Navigated to /calendar, switched to March 2025 month view
   - Header shows "1 Post in Maerz 2025"
3. Verify post appears on March 15th - PASS
   - Month view: Post card visible on day 15 with title "SCHEDULE_TEST_124_March15", category icon, badge "1"
   - Week view: SA 15 column shows "1 Post"
   - API GET /api/calendar?month=3&year=2025 returns post under "2025-03-15" key in posts_by_date
4. Verify time displays as 14:00 in user's timezone - PASS
   - Month view: Post card shows "14:00" text
   - Month view tooltip: "SCHEDULE_TEST_124_March15 - Laender - Geplant um 14:00"
   - Week view: Post card placed in 14:00 time slot row (between 13:00 and 15:00)
   - Week view: Post card shows "14:00" text
   - Week view tooltip: "SCHEDULE_TEST_124_March15 - Laender - Geplant - 14:00"
   - API response: scheduled_time: "14:00"

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)

  - feature124-step3-week-view-14h-slot.png (week view header SA 15 = 1 Post)
  - feature124-step4-week-view-14h-visible.png (week view with post in 14:00 slot)

### No code changes needed:
- posts.py schedule_post() already correctly stores date/time and sets status to "scheduled"
- calendar.py get_calendar() already groups posts by date and returns scheduled_time
- CalendarView.vue already displays post.scheduled_time in both month and week views
- Week view getPostsAtTimeSlot() correctly matches post hour to time slot

### Current state:
- Feature #124 marked as PASSING
- 126/170 features passing (74.1%)

## Session - Feature #122: URL manipulation does not expose other users data
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Fixed security vulnerabilities in slides.py and export.py where post ownership was not verified
- Verified complete user data isolation between two test users (User A and User B)
- All API endpoints return 404 when a user tries to access another user's posts

### Security fixes applied:
1. **slides.py GET /{post_id}/slides** - Added post ownership check (was missing, any user could read any post's slides)
2. **slides.py POST /{post_id}/slides** - Added post ownership check (was missing, any user could add slides to any post)
3. **slides.py DELETE /{post_id}/slides/{slide_id}** - Added post ownership check (was missing)
4. **export.py GET /download/{export_id}** - Added post ownership check via export's post_id (was missing, any user could download any export)
5. **posts.py** - Already had proper isolation on all 7 endpoints (GET list, GET single, POST create, PUT update, DELETE, POST duplicate, PUT schedule, PUT status)

### Verification steps completed:
1. Created User A (usera_isolation122@treff.de, id=212) and User B (userb_isolation122@treff.de, id=213)
2. Created post #140 as User A with title "ISOLATION_TEST_122_SECRET_DATA"
3. API tests as User B (all returned 404):
   - GET /api/posts/140 -> 404 "Post not found"
   - PUT /api/posts/140 -> 404 "Post not found"
   - DELETE /api/posts/140 -> 404 "Post not found"
   - GET /api/posts/140/slides -> 404 "Post not found"
   - POST /api/posts/140/duplicate -> 404 "Post not found"
4. Unauthenticated access -> 401 "Could not validate credentials"
5. User A can still access own post -> 200 OK with full data
6. User B listing all posts -> empty array []
7. Browser UI verification:
   - User A dashboard shows the post -> PASS
   - User A can edit at /create-post?edit=140 -> PASS

## Session - Feature #118: Page refresh preserves current page and data
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Fixed auth state not fully persisting across page refreshes
- Before fix: tokens were stored in localStorage but user data (display_name) was lost on refresh
- After fix: initializeAuth() in auth store fetches user data via /api/auth/me when tokens exist

### Code changes:
1. **frontend/src/stores/auth.js**:
   - Added `initialized` ref to prevent duplicate initialization calls
   - Added `initializeAuth()` async function that checks for existing tokens and fetches user data
   - Exported both new properties from the store
2. **frontend/src/router/index.js**:
   - Made `beforeEach` guard async to await auth initialization
   - Added `await auth.initializeAuth()` call before route checks

  - Empty state v-if: added `.trim()` check for searchQuery
- backend/app/api/routes/posts.py:
  - `list_posts()`: added `.strip()` check so whitespace-only search doesn't apply ILIKE filter

### Verification steps completed:
1. Navigate to History - PASS (logged in as whitespace115@treff.de, navigated to /history)
2. Enter only spaces in search box - PASS (typed 5 spaces via keyboard)
3. Verify app does not crash - PASS (zero console errors, page renders normally)
4. Verify all results shown - PASS:
   - "1 Post gefunden" displayed (same as no search)

- Field validation errors return 422 with structured per-field error details (field name, message, type)
- Normal valid requests (login, register, etc.) still work correctly

### Files modified:
- backend/app/main.py - Added imports (Request, RequestValidationError, JSONResponse) and custom exception handler

### Verification steps completed:
1. POST /api/posts with invalid JSON body - PASS (returns 400 with "Bad Request: The request body contains malformed JSON. Please send a valid JSON object.")
2. Verify 400 Bad Request response - PASS (status code is 400, not 422)
3. Verify meaningful error message returned - PASS (detail field explains the issue clearly)
4. POST /api/auth/login with missing fields - PASS (returns 422 with field-specific errors: "email: Field required", "password: Field required")
5. Verify appropriate validation error - PASS (each missing field listed with name and error type)

### Additional verification:
- Tested from browser via fetch() calls (same-origin on backend port) - all 3 scenarios pass
- Login flow still works end-to-end (registered test98@treff.de, logged in, saw dashboard)
- Zero JavaScript console errors
- All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- Edge cases verified: single missing field, invalid email format, short password - all return appropriate errors
- Screenshots: feature98-api-error-handling-results.png, feature98-login-works-after-changes.png

### Current state:
- Feature #98 marked as PASSING
- 102/170 features passing (60.0%)

## Session - Feature #97: API returns 404 for non-existent resource IDs
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified that API correctly returns 404 for non-existent post and template IDs
- No code changes needed - all functionality was already properly implemented:
  - Backend posts.py: `HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Post not found")`
  - Backend templates.py: `HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Template not found")`

### Verification steps completed:
1. GET /api/posts/99999 (non-existent) - PASS: Returns 404 with {"detail": "Post not found"}
2. Verify 404 Not Found response - PASS: HTTP status 404, statusText "Not Found"
3. GET /api/templates/99999 - PASS: Returns 404 with {"detail": "Template not found"}
4. Verify 404 response - PASS: HTTP status 404, statusText "Not Found"
5. Verify error message is meaningful - PASS: "Post not found" and "Template not found" are clear, descriptive error messages

### Additional edge case testing:
- GET /api/posts/12345 -> 404 "Post not found" (PASS)
- GET /api/templates/12345 -> 404 "Template not found" (PASS)
- GET /api/posts/0 -> 404 "Post not found" (PASS)
- GET /api/templates/0 -> 404 "Template not found" (PASS)
- GET /api/posts/abc -> 422 validation error (correct type validation)
- GET /api/posts/99999 without auth -> 401 (auth enforced before 404)

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] Browser-verified via Playwright with API calls from authenticated browser session
- [x] Screenshots: feature97-dashboard-logged-in.png, feature97-404-test-results.png

### No code changes needed:
- posts.py already had `raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Post not found")`
- templates.py already had `raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Template not found")`

### Current state:

## Session - Feature #96: API returns 401 for requests without valid JWT
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Fixed HTTPBearer security to return 401 (Unauthorized) instead of 403 (Forbidden) for missing/invalid JWT tokens
- Changed `HTTPBearer()` to `HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)` so missing credentials are handled manually
- Added explicit `None` check in `get_current_user_id()` to raise 401 when no Authorization header is provided

### Code changes:
- `backend/app/core/security.py`:
  - Line 13: `HTTPBearer()` -> `HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)`
  - Line 51: Made credentials parameter `Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]`
  - Lines 59-60: Added `if credentials is None: raise credentials_exception`

### Verification steps completed:
1. GET /api/posts without Authorization header - PASS (401 "Could not validate credentials")
2. GET /api/posts with expired token - PASS (401 "Could not validate credentials")
3. GET /api/posts with valid token - PASS (200 with empty array [])
4. Additional tests:
   - Garbage/invalid token string -> 401
   - Refresh token used as access token -> 401
   - Other endpoints (templates, analytics, settings, calendar) all return 401 without auth
5. Browser UI verification:
   - Navigating to /dashboard without login redirects to /login page
   - After login, dashboard loads successfully with "Feature96 Test" user
6. Server restart persistence:
   - Restarted backend server
   - All 401/200 behavior confirmed after restart
7. Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
8. Mock data grep checks: zero matches in security.py

### Current state:

- Added `onMounted` hook to reload templates/assets when returning to an in-progress workflow
- Reset workflow function delegates to `store.resetWorkflow()` for centralized state management

### Files created/modified:
- frontend/src/stores/createPost.js - NEW: Pinia store for Create Post workflow state
- frontend/src/views/CreatePostView.vue - Modified: use store refs instead of local refs

### Verification steps completed:

## Session - Feature #26: Back button works correctly after form submission
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified back button behavior after form submission in the Create Post wizard
- Test flow: Dashboard -> Create Post -> complete wizard (export complete) -> back button -> Dashboard
- Confirmed back button navigates to previous page (Dashboard), not re-submitting the form
- Confirmed forward button shows a fresh Create Post form (Step 1), not the completed state
- Confirmed no duplicate posts created by back/forward browser navigation
- Created 2 test posts to verify exact count before and after back button press
- Also committed breadcrumb navigation addition to CreatePostView.vue from a previous session

### Verification steps completed:
1. Navigate to Create Post and complete a post creation - PASS (created post, set export complete state)
2. Click browser back button - PASS (navigated to /dashboard, not re-submit)
3. Verify user goes to previous page (not re-submit) - PASS (dashboard fully rendered with post count)
4. Verify no duplicate post is created - PASS (exactly 2 posts before and after back button)

### Technical notes:
- Vue SPA uses client-side routing (createWebHistory), so form submissions are XHR/fetch calls
- Browser back button navigates to previous route in history, component state is destroyed
- Forward navigation recreates CreatePostView with fresh default state (Step 1)
- No traditional HTML form POST means no browser "re-submit" dialog risk

### Additional verification:
- Zero JavaScript console errors
- All 7 mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- Test data cleaned up after verification (both test posts deleted)
- Screenshots: feature26-step1-export-complete.png, feature26-step2-back-to-dashboard.png, feature26-step3-forward-fresh-form.png

## Session - Feature #21: Default templates cannot be deleted
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified that default (system) templates are fully protected from deletion at both UI and API levels
- No code changes needed - protection was already implemented in previous sessions

### Verification steps completed:
1. Navigate to Templates page - PASS (22 von 22 Templates shown)
2. Find a default (system) template - PASS (e.g., "Erfahrungsbericht Carousel" with green "Standard" badge)

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Implemented full AI image generation feature in post editor (Step 8)
- Backend: Rewrote /api/ai/generate-image endpoint with:
  - Gemini API integration (uses google-genai SDK when API key configured)
  - Fallback: Pillow-based branded placeholder image generation
  - Theme-aware color gradients based on prompt keywords (USA=blue/red, Canada=red/green, etc.)
  - Generated images saved to asset library with source="ai_generated" and ai_prompt stored

## Session - Feature #14: JWT tokens refresh automatically before expiry
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Fixed critical bug in refresh endpoint: `user.id` was passed as integer instead of `str(user.id)`, causing `JWTClaimsError: Subject must be a string` when the refreshed token was used for authenticated API calls
- The fix aligns the refresh endpoint with the login endpoint (both now use `str(user.id)`)
- Verified the complete JWT refresh flow end-to-end via API and browser automation

### Bug fix:
- **File:** `backend/app/api/routes/auth.py` (line 104-105)
- **Before:** `create_access_token(data={"sub": user.id})` (integer sub claim)
- **After:** `create_access_token(data={"sub": str(user.id)})` (string sub claim)
- Same fix for `create_refresh_token` on the same endpoint

### Verification steps completed:
1. Login and capture access token - PASS (tokens returned with correct structure)
2. Verify access token has short expiry (1 hour) - PASS (59.8 minutes, type="access")
3. Verify refresh token exists with longer expiry (7 days) - PASS (7.0 days, type="refresh")
4. Call POST /api/auth/refresh with refresh token - PASS (HTTP 200, new tokens returned)
5. Verify new access token is returned - PASS (different token, valid JWT, same user sub)
6. Verify old access token is replaced in app state - PASS (browser test: set invalid token, navigated to /history, interceptor auto-refreshed, page loaded successfully, localStorage updated with new valid JWT)

### Additional verification:
- Zero JavaScript console errors
- Zero mock data pattern matches in frontend/src and backend/app
- New access token successfully used for /api/auth/me endpoint
- Frontend axios interceptor correctly handles 401 -> refresh -> retry flow
- Screenshots captured: feature14-token-refresh-success.png

## Session - Feature #12: User can logout successfully
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified complete logout flow end-to-end via browser automation

  - TopBar.vue: "Logout" button calls auth.logout() + router.push('/login')
  - auth.js store: logout() clears accessToken, refreshToken, user from state and localStorage
  - Router beforeEach guard redirects unauthenticated users to /login?redirect=...

### Verification steps completed:
1. Login as registered user (test@treff.de) - PASS (redirected to /dashboard)
2. Click logout button in TopBar - PASS (button visible, clicked)
3. Verify redirect to login page - PASS (URL = /login)
4. Verify tokens cleared - PASS (localStorage.access_token = null, refresh_token = null)
5. Try to access /dashboard - PASS (redirects to /login?redirect=/dashboard)
6. Try to access /settings - PASS (redirects to /login?redirect=/settings)
7. Try to access /templates - PASS (redirects to /login?redirect=/templates)

### Additional verification:
- Zero JavaScript console errors

2. Verified success toast notification appears - accessibility snapshot confirmed alert element with "Post erfolgreich erstellt und gespeichert!"
3. Verified toast auto-dismisses after ~5 seconds - used waitFor({state:'hidden'}), confirmed element removed from DOM
4. Verified toast shows relevant message - "Post erfolgreich erstellt und gespeichert!" (Post successfully created and saved)
5. Repeated test with second post (Post ID #37) - same results

### Additional checks:
- Zero console errors

### Analytics page sections:
1. **Overview stats cards**: Posts gesamt, Posts diese Woche, Posts diesen Monat
   - Uses TREFF brand colors (blue for week, yellow for month)
2. **Zielverfolgung (Goal tracking)**: Weekly 5/4 posts (100%), Monthly 5/16 (31%)

### Important note for future sessions:
- There are TWO treff.db files: one in root dir and one in backend/ dir
- init.sh runs from backend/ dir, so the correct DB is backend/treff.db
- Manual uvicorn restarts must be done from backend/ dir to use the same DB

## Session 4 - Feature #5: Backend API queries real database
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Enabled SQL_ECHO=True in backend .env to capture SQL queries in server logs
- Tested POST /api/auth/register via browser (Swagger UI fetch):
  - Server logs show: SELECT users... WHERE users.email = ? (check for existing)
  - Server logs show: INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, display_name, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  - Response: 201 Created with user data
- Tested POST /api/auth/login via browser:
  - Server logs show: SELECT users... WHERE users.email = ? (find user for auth)
  - Response: 200 OK with JWT access_token
- Tested GET /api/posts via browser with JWT auth:
  - Server logs show: SELECT posts... FROM posts WHERE posts.user_id = ? ORDER BY posts.created_at DESC
  - Response: 200 OK with empty array (correct for new user)
- Verified all 10 route files use Depends(get_db) - 47 total real DB dependency usages
- All mock data pattern greps returned zero matches
- Zero console errors in browser
- Reverted SQL_ECHO back to False after verification

### Evidence from server logs (SQL_ECHO=True):
1. Health check: SELECT 1 + SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
2. Register: SELECT users WHERE email=? + INSERT INTO users + SELECT users WHERE id=?
3. Login: SELECT users WHERE email=?
4. GET posts: SELECT posts WHERE user_id=? ORDER BY created_at DESC
5. POST posts (from parallel session): INSERT INTO posts VALUES(...)

### Current state:
- Feature #1 (Database connection established): PASSING

- Feature #5 (Backend API queries real database): PASSING
- 4/163 features complete (2.5%)
- Backend running on port 8000
- Frontend running on port 5173

### Next steps:
- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart
- Then move to authentication features (#6-#11)

## Session 5 - Feature #3: Data persists across server restart
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Fixed 3 critical bugs preventing data persistence:
  1. **bcrypt/passlib incompatibility**: passlib 1.7.4 crashes with bcrypt 4.x.
     Replaced passlib with direct bcrypt usage in security.py.
  2. **JWT sub claim type**: python-jose requires `sub` to be a string, not int.
     Fixed auth.py to pass `str(user.id)` in token creation.
  3. **Post data rollback bug (CRITICAL)**: FastAPI's JSON serialization of SQLAlchemy
     models triggered lazy-loading of relationships in async context, causing
     MissingGreenlet error. This exception was caught by get_db() except clause,
     triggering a rollback - so posts appeared to save but were actually rolled back.
     Fix: convert models to plain dicts before returning + explicit commit.

### Persistence test results:
1. Register user -> OK (user created in DB)
2. Login -> OK (JWT token with string sub)
3. Create post "RESTART_TEST_12345" -> OK (committed to disk)
4. Verify post in GET /api/posts -> Found
5. STOP server (kill -9, verify port 8000 free) -> Confirmed stopped
6. RESTART server -> Healthy, DB connected
7. Login again -> OK
8. GET /api/posts -> **RESTART_TEST_12345 STILL EXISTS** -> PASS

### Mock data grep: All clean (no matches in backend/app or frontend/src)
### Browser verification: App loads, auth works, zero console errors

### Files modified:
- backend/app/core/security.py - direct bcrypt instead of passlib
- backend/app/api/routes/auth.py - str(user.id) for JWT sub
- backend/app/api/routes/posts.py - explicit commit + post_to_dict serialization
- backend/requirements.txt - bcrypt==4.2.1 replaces passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4

### Important notes for future sessions:
- Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for curl (IPv6 resolution fails)
- Other route files (templates, assets, calendar, etc.) may need the same
  dict serialization fix when those features are implemented
- SQL_ECHO was left as True in .env by session 4 (reverted to True by external)

### Current state:
- Feature #1 (Database connection established): PASSING
- Feature #2 (Database schema applied correctly): PASSING
- Feature #3 (Data persists across server restart): PASSING
- Feature #4 (No mock data patterns in codebase): PASSING
- Feature #5 (Backend API queries real database): PASSING
- 5/163 features complete (3.1%) - ALL INFRASTRUCTURE PASSING

## Session 12 - Feature #13: Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Cleared all auth tokens from localStorage
- Tested all protected routes as unauthenticated user:
  - /dashboard → redirects to /login?redirect=/dashboard ✅
  - /posts → redirects to /login?redirect=/posts ✅
  - /settings → redirects to /login?redirect=/settings ✅
  - /templates → redirects to /login?redirect=/templates ✅
  - /analytics → redirects to /login?redirect=/analytics ✅
- Verified backend API also rejects unauthenticated requests:
  - /api/posts → 403 "Not authenticated"
  - /api/auth/me → 403 "Not authenticated"
  - /api/settings → 403 "Not authenticated"
  - /api/templates → 403 "Not authenticated"
  - /api/analytics/overview → 403 "Not authenticated"
- Zero JavaScript console errors
- All mock data grep checks passed (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- Screenshots captured: feature13-dashboard-redirect.png, feature13-settings-redirect.png

### No code changes needed:
- Router beforeEach guard already correctly checks `to.meta.requiresAuth !== false && !auth.isAuthenticated`
- All routes under AppLayout (/) have meta.requiresAuth: true (inherited by children)
- Catch-all route also triggers auth guard (no meta.requiresAuth: false)
- Backend uses Depends(get_current_user) on all protected endpoints returning 403

### Current state:
- Features #1-11, #13 passing (infrastructure + layout + auth + security)
- 11/163 features complete (6.7%)

- Verified 404 page displays correctly with:
  - "404" heading in TREFF blue
  - "Seite nicht gefunden" subtitle
  - "Die angeforderte Seite existiert nicht." description
  - "Zurueck zum Dashboard" link/button
- Fixed bug: original button used `router.push('/dashboard')` which caused dynamic import
  errors when navigating from the catch-all 404 route. Module imports for AppLayout.vue
  and DashboardView.vue failed with MIME type errors due to Vite SPA module resolution.
- Fix: replaced `<button @click="router.push(...)">` with `<router-link to="/dashboard">`
  which is the proper Vue Router pattern and handles navigation reliably.
- Verified clicking "Zurueck zum Dashboard" navigates to /dashboard with full dashboard rendered
- Zero JavaScript console errors after fix
- All mock data grep checks passed (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- Screenshots captured: feature27-404-page-verified.png, feature27-dashboard-after-404.png

## Session - Feature #80: Post history can be filtered by category
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified existing category filter functionality on History page end-to-end via browser
- Category filter was already fully implemented (both frontend and backend)
- Created 6 test posts across 3 categories: laender_spotlight (3), erfahrungsberichte (2), tipps_tricks (1)
- Tested all feature steps through browser automation:
  1. All 6 posts visible with "Alle Kategorien" selected
  2. Applied "Laender-Spotlight" filter -> 3 posts shown (correct)
  3. Applied "Erfahrungsberichte" filter -> 2 posts shown (correct)
  4. Cleared filter via "Filter zuruecksetzen" button -> all 6 posts returned
- Fixed .env DATABASE_URL to use default absolute path from config.py instead of relative ./treff.db
  (relative path caused wrong DB file when server started from different CWD)

### Bug fix:
- backend/.env: Commented out relative DATABASE_URL so config.py default (absolute path) is used
  This prevents CWD-dependent database resolution on server restart

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Created posts in different categories (laender_spotlight, erfahrungsberichte, tipps_tricks)
- [x] Navigated to History page, all posts visible (6 Posts gefunden)
- [x] Applied laender_spotlight filter -> only 3 matching posts shown
- [x] Applied erfahrungsberichte filter -> only 2 matching posts shown
- [x] Cleared filter -> all 6 posts returned
- [x] Zero JS console errors
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] Server restart persistence verified: all 6 posts persist, login works, filters work after restart
- [x] API-level filter verification: GET /api/posts?category=laender_spotlight returns 3, erfahrungsberichte returns 2
- [x] Screenshots captured: feature80-all-posts.png, feature80-laender-filter.png, feature80-erfahrung-filter.png, feature80-filter-cleared.png, feature80-after-restart.png

  - Structured JSON output via `response_mime_type="application/json"`
  - `gemini-2.5-flash` model with temperature=0.8, max_output_tokens=4096
  - Full response validation (required keys, slide structure, field defaults)
- Created `_build_gemini_system_prompt(tone)` with distinct jugendlich/serioess instructions:
  - Jugendlich: Du-Anrede, 3-5 emojis, begeisternd, country flags
  - Serioess: Sie-Anrede, max 2-3 emojis, Sicherheit/Erfahrung/Betreuung focus
- Created `_build_gemini_content_prompt()` with category, country, topic, slide_count details
- Modified `generate_text_content()` to accept optional `api_key` parameter:
  - Tries Gemini first when api_key provided
  - Falls back to rule-based templates when no key or API error
  - Returns `"source": "gemini"` or `"source": "rule_based"` field
- Created `_regenerate_field_with_gemini()` for single field AI regeneration
- Updated `regenerate_single_field()` with same Gemini-first, fallback logic

5. Fallback to rule-based when no API key - PASS (tested: no key => source="rule_based", invalid key => source="rule_based")
6. generate_text_content() tries Gemini first, then fallback - PASS (api_key param added, Gemini tried first)
7. POST /api/ai/generate-text returns KI-generated text - PASS:
   - Curl test with jugendlich tone: source="gemini", 3 slides with German text, emojis, TREFF branding
   - Curl test with serioess tone: source="gemini", Sie-Anrede, "Seit 1984", professional language
8. Generated text is German with TREFF branding - PASS:
   - All content in German
   - TREFF Sprachreisen mentioned in captions
   - Country flags (🇺🇸, 🇨🇦) used correctly
   - Hashtags mix German/English (#TREFFSprachreisen #Auslandsjahr #StudyAbroad)

## Session - Feature #102: Toast notifications stack and auto-dismiss
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified complete toast notification stacking and auto-dismiss behavior end-to-end via browser
- No code changes needed - all functionality was already fully implemented:
  - Composable: useToast.js with addToast(), removeToast(), success(), error(), info() functions
  - Component: ToastContainer.vue with Teleport, TransitionGroup animations, close buttons
  - Integration: Used in CreatePostView, AssetCropModal, api.js error interceptor, useReminders

### Verification steps completed:
1. Trigger multiple actions in quick succession - PASS
   - Triggered 3 toasts simultaneously (success, error, info)
   - All 3 appeared instantly in the toast container
2. Verify multiple toasts stack vertically - PASS
   - Screenshot confirms 3 toasts stacked vertically in top-right corner
   - Each with proper color coding: green (success), red (error), blue (info)
   - Each with icon, message text, and close (x) button
   - Proper gap spacing between stacked toasts
3. Verify each toast auto-dismisses after timeout - PASS
   - Created 3 toasts with 15s timeout
   - Waited 16 seconds
   - All 3 toasts automatically disappeared
   - Toast array confirmed empty (length = 0)
4. Verify toasts can be manually dismissed by clicking - PASS
   - Created 3 persistent toasts (duration=0)
   - Clicked close button on middle toast (error) - it disappeared, others remained
   - Clicked close button on first toast (success) - it disappeared
   - Clicked close button on last toast (info) - it disappeared
   - All toasts properly removed from array after manual dismiss

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] No 500s in network requests
- [x] Screenshots captured:
  - feature102-step1-three-toasts-stacked.png (3 toasts of different types stacked)
  - feature102-step2-stacked-toasts-three-types.png (controlled 15s toasts stacked)
  - feature102-step3-toasts-auto-dismissed.png (all toasts auto-dismissed after timeout)

## Session - Feature #108: Deleted post no longer appears in search results
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified the complete search cleanup workflow end-to-end via browser
- No code changes needed - all functionality was already fully implemented:
  - Backend: DELETE /api/posts/{post_id} permanently removes the post from SQLite database
  - Backend: GET /api/posts?search=... server-side ILIKE search returns empty results for deleted posts
  - Frontend: HistoryView.vue search input triggers fetchPosts() which queries the API
  - Frontend: Delete confirmation dialog with "Loeschen" button removes post and refreshes list

### Verification steps completed:
1. Create post with title CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST - PASS
   - Created post #125 via API with category laender_spotlight, platform instagram_feed
   - Post stored in SQLite database with all fields
2. Verify it appears in History search - PASS
   - Navigated to /history, typed "CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST" in search box
   - Shows "1 Post gefunden" with correct post card (title, category, platform, date)
   - Screenshot: feature108-step2-search-found.png
3. Delete the post - PASS
   - Clicked trash icon on the post card
   - Confirmation dialog appeared: "Post loeschen? ... CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST"
   - Clicked "Loeschen" to confirm deletion
4. Search for CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST - PASS
   - Immediately after deletion, search shows "Keine Posts gefunden"
   - Reset filters, re-searched "CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST" - still zero results
   - Screenshot: feature108-step3-deleted-no-results.png, feature108-step5-search-zero-results.png
5. Verify zero results - PASS
   - API GET /api/posts?search=CLEANUP_SEARCH_TEST returns [] (empty array)
   - API GET /api/posts/125 returns 404 "Post not found"
   - UI shows "Keine Posts gefunden" message

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] No 500s in network requests
- [x] Post permanently removed from database (404 on direct ID lookup)
- [x] Screenshots captured:
  - feature108-step2-search-found.png (search shows post before deletion)
  - feature108-step3-deleted-no-results.png (search shows zero results after deletion)
  - feature108-step5-search-zero-results.png (re-search confirms zero results)

### No code changes needed:
- posts.py DELETE endpoint already permanently removes post from database via db.delete()
- posts.py GET endpoint with search param uses ILIKE across title, slide_data, captions
- HistoryView.vue already had search input triggering fetchPosts() and proper UI refresh after delete
- Delete confirmation dialog already present with idempotent double-click guard

### Current state:
- Feature #108 marked as PASSING
- 110/170 features passing (64.7%)

## Session - Feature #114: Special characters in search do not crash app
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** PASSING

### What was accomplished:
- Verified that special characters in the History search box do not crash the app
- Tested three types of malicious/special input:
  1. XSS payload: `<script>alert(1)</script>` - no alert popup, no crash, rendered as literal text
  2. URL-encoded special chars: `%25&=?#` - no crash, graceful empty results
  3. SQL injection: `'; DROP TABLE posts; --` - no crash, parameterized queries prevent injection
- All tests showed "Keine Posts gefunden" with zero console errors
- Filter reset button works correctly after special character searches

### Why no code changes were needed:
- Backend: SQLAlchemy ORM uses parameterized queries via `.ilike()` - SQL injection impossible
- Frontend: Vue 3 auto-escapes all template interpolations `{{ }}` - XSS impossible
- Frontend: axios properly URL-encodes query parameters - special chars handled by HTTP layer
- Backend: FastAPI properly decodes URL-encoded parameters

### Verification steps completed:
1. Navigate to History - PASS (logged in as special114@treff.de, navigated to /history)
2. Search for `<script>alert(1)</script>` - PASS (no error, no crash, no XSS execution)
3. Verify no error or crash occurs - PASS (zero console errors, graceful "Keine Posts gefunden")
4. Search for `%25&=?#` - PASS (no error, no crash, graceful empty results)
5. Verify graceful handling with empty results - PASS (all special chars displayed as literal text)

### Additional tests:
- SQL injection `'; DROP TABLE posts; --` - PASS (parameterized queries safe)
- Filter reset after special chars - PASS (app recovers to normal state)

### Verification checklist:
- [x] Zero JavaScript console errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All mock data grep checks clean (zero matches in frontend/src and backend/app)
- [x] No 500s in network requests
- [x] Authentication required (JWT protected endpoint)
- [x] Screenshots captured:
  - feature114-step1-xss-search.png (XSS payload in search - no crash)
  - feature114-step2-special-chars-search.png (%25&=?# in search - no crash)
  - feature114-step3-sql-injection-search.png (SQL injection attempt - no crash)

### Current state:
- Feature #114 marked as PASSING
- 116/170 features passing (68.2%)
